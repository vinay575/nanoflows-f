You are a senior UI designer + frontend engineer. Build a professional multi-page service section for my website.

📌 Requirements
1. On the home/services page, each service card must be clickable.
2. Clicking a card should redirect to a dedicated detail page for that service.
3. Create individual pages for each service (example: Web Development, AI Solutions, Cloud Services, UI/UX Design, etc.).
4. Each service detail page must be visually premium, modern, and professional.

🎨 Design + UI Requirements
- Each service detail page must have:
  • Full-width hero banner with relevant high-quality image
  • Animated headline and sub-text
  • Subtle fade-in / slide-up transitions for each section on scroll
  • Modern color theme + gradient section backgrounds
  • Icons, feature highlights, and service process steps
  • "Why choose us" section with animated cards
  • Testimonial block (optional)
  • Call To Action at bottom with button → Contact/Booking form

- Use smooth entrance animation on scroll (AOS, Framer Motion, GSAP, or CSS transitions)
- Hero text must animate with fade + upward motion
- Section blocks appear with staggered reveal animation
- Buttons hover with scale + shadow expansion
